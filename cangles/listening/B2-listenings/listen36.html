          <p>.  JOHANNA PALMER:
            Mr. Cody, thank you very much for accepting our invitation.
          </p><p>. GEORGE CODY
            : You’re welcome.
            Thank you for inviting me and for giving me the
            opportunity to talk about meteorites.
          </p><p>. JOHANNA:
            I’d like to begin by asking you about Prof. Hoover and his fascinating
            discovery. His
            findings
            seem to
            give firm evidence
            that we are not alone in the
            universe
            !
          </p><p>.CODY
            : Indeed, this is an amazing theory. And if this was true, those alien life forms
            may have a lot more in common with life on Earth than we had previously thought.
          </p><p>.JOHANNA
            : All right Mr. Cody, but, as someone said once, extraordinary discoveries
            require extraordinary
            proof
            . As far as I understand, in this case the proof seems to be
            missing. Could you tell us your opinion about Prof. Hoover's discovery?
          </p><p>.CODY:
            Well, first of all, I have to say that if Prof. Hoover's
            claim
            was true, this would
            be one of the most important scientific discoveries ever made. Unfortunately, I agree
            with most other scientists who say that there is no proof that this is true.
          </p><p>.JOHANNA
            : This isn't the first time that NASA sci
            entist Richard Hoover has claimed to
            see signs of life in meteorites. Why do you think that this particular article and not
            others got special attention?
            CODY:
            I really have no idea; it is one of those media mysteries!
          </p><p>. JOHANNA
            : Could you explain, for those of us who are not experts on meteorites, what Prof. Hoover's main
            claim
            actually is?
          </p><p>.CODY:
            The main idea defended by Prof. Hoover is
            that a microscopic evaluation of
            these meteorites shows that they contai
            n filaments that might have been formed by a
            living organism, such as bacteria. But there
            are other possible explanations, too. There
            are all sorts of chemical processes that might have created those filaments.
          </p><p>. JOHANNA
            : But, does that mean that the bacteria found on meteorites might possibly
            not come from space?
          </p><p>.CODY:
            It's hard to be certain that any signs of life you see in meteorites found on Earth
            came from
            outer
            space. In fact, it's more likely that the bacteria infected the meteorite
            after it arrived on Earth, or even when they were picked up by scientists for
            examination.
          </p><p>.JOHANNA
            : So, in other words, you pick this thing up –this fragment of meteorite—from
            the ground and, almost immediately, if you're not careful, even from the bacteria on
            your hands, you've contaminated the meteorite!
          </p><p>.CODY:
            Absolutely. This is a more than probable conclusion. Contamination is almost
            unavoidable
            .
          </p><p>.JOHANNA
            : So, if human contamination is more than likely, why do you think Prof.
            Hoover is defending the idea that the bacteria came from outer space?
          </p><p>. CODY:
            Well, you must remember that scientists are obsessed with discoveries. We
            always want to discover something new, that's why we're in the game! And if you
            discover something that seems like it might be extraordinary,[ ...] well, there's this in
            human nature: you tend to think, “wow, I’ve made this great discovery, I have to share
            it with the world!”
          </p><p>.JOHANNA
            : But scientists must be very careful and absolutely sure before they publish
            their
            findings
            , don’t you think?
          </p><p>.CODY:
            Absolutely! Fifteen years ago, another group of scientists claimed they’d found
            signs of life in a meteorite from Mars recovered in Antarctica. The media also gave it
            full
            coverage
            ; even other scientists supported the theory. But only a few years later,
            most scientists were convinced the finding was false. So this time, most scientists are
            skeptical about Prof. Hoover’s claim for evidence of bacterial life in meteorites.
          </p><p>.JOHANNA
: So, if a scientific discovery turns out to be wrong, is that necessarily a bad
thing?
</p><p>.CODY:
Well, no; not necessarily. It often happens that we learn more from mistakes
than we do from successes! These meteorites from Mars probably don't have any
evidence of life in them, but they su
rely have some fascinating chemistry.
</p><p>.JOHANNA
: So would you say that there is any chance at all that Prof. Hoover’s new
finding is correct, this time?
</p><p>.CODY
: Well, there have been some extraordinary claims in the past that turned out to
be right. You see, sometimes it takes years for scientific findings to be confirmed right.
But this only happens once in a while.
</p><p>.JOHANNA
: But what will happen if the new claim is wrong?
</p><p>.CODY:
Then it will be corrected. There's no question about it. Scientists will come up
with the correct explanation for these structures, and we'll move on. And that's the way
science progresses.
</p><p>.JOHANNA:
Well, Mr. Cody, thank you so much for your time and for sharing your
views with us.
</p><p>.CODY:
Thank you. It's been my pleasure
