            Anne Smith:
            Hello. My name is Anne Smith, and on today’s programme
            Dr John Thomson is
            going to help us find out why smart phones are so addictive and how can we break our
            dependence on them. Can we learn how to renegotiate our relationship with our smart phone?
          </p><p>.Anne
            Smith
            : Throw your mobile phone hard against a brick wall. Just imagine it. How does it
            feel for you? What emotions come up in your mind and in your body? What about when you
            reali
            z
            e you've left your mobile device at home, or in a taxi? Dr Thomson, have we
            become
            addicted to our mobile phones?
          </p><p>.John Thomson
            : Well... to a certain extent we are. The well
            -
            known example of people sitting
            around the dinner table, each of them on their phones, is a terrible example of it. But we make a
            lot of assumptions about tec
            hnology that aren't quite right.
          </p><p>.Anne Smith
            : What do you mean by that?
          </p><p>. John Thomson
            : Well, one of the assumptions we are making is that this is an inevitable
            process. We assume that these technologies do a lot of wonderful things for us. For example,
            they
            allow us to be in touch with people and get information from all over the globe. But then we
            also have to become aware that they are related to problems of distraction and information
            overload
            . I think there are things that we can do about it.
          </p><p>. Anne Smith
            :
            Can you give us some examples?
          </p><p>. John Thomson
            : Well, we need to observe our behaviour when using technology. Almost
            everything that human beings do now uses digital technology, whether it's business,
            entertainment, or socialising. Smart phones have entered a
            ll those areas and have become
            essential. We need to learn to become aware of the effects that our devices are having on us as
            the basis for figuring out how to use them well.
          </p><p>.Anne Smith
            : So what do you suggest we do?
          </p><p>.John Thomson
            : So really what I'm sugg
            esting is that there is a lot of power in bringing
            mindfulness
            to our use of these devices to use them in more intentional ways. For example,
            take the time to observe what we are feeling when we get a text message. We need to learn to
            change our habits by
            conscious observation and reflection.
          </p><p>.Anne Smith
            : How can we use our digital devices in ways that are healthier?
          </p><p>.John Thomson
: Our habits are based on a reward system. We humans have developed such a
system as a way to help us find where food is. So on a
very simple level, we have to remember
where to get food, and before there were grocery stores, our brains had to have mechanisms to
learn to remember where food was. From a neurobiological standpoint, reward comes in the
form of
dopamine
. So if food is ri
ch in calories, then our stomach sends a signal off to our brain
through dopamine that says, hey, remember what you ate and where you found it. This is the
way actions become habits.
</p><p>.Anne Smith
: And so this same reward mechanism applies to everything?
</p><p>.John
Thomson
: That’s right. Let's take a simple example; stress may make us eat cupcakes or
chocolate, and then we feel better, that's the reward, so that becomes a habit. Well, the same
thing is true with technology. If we get stressed out and then we go and
distract ourselves by
surfing the internet on our phone, that temporary distraction gives that same type of temporary
reward.
</p><p>.Anne Smith
: So we are still being rewarded by that dopamine hit.
</p><p>.John Thomson
: Yes, and some of the technologies, for example, email or texting, maximise
that type of hit. If we knew that we were going to get an email every 30 seconds, then our brain
would start expecting that and would not get the big dopamine hit that it gets wit
h random
emails. So this technology basically
boosts
our dopamine system and trains us to develop
expectations.
</p><p>.Anne Smith
: What can mindfulness training, then, do for us? And how do we develop
mindfulness?
</p><p>.John Thomson
: For example, I would just say to pe
ople “Think about your phone. Don't even
take it out yet. Just bring it to mind. What happens when you think about your phone, what
happens to your breathing? Does your body posture change? What emotions come up when
you think about your phone? And what do
es it do to the quality of your attention?” So these are
the first questions I ask.
</p><p>.Anne Smith
: Right, I see...
</p><p>.John Thomson
: Then I would say “Now I want you take your phone out, I want you to hold it in
your hand. I don't want you to turn it on yet. Not
ice what's going on with your emotions”. Then I
ask people to turn on their phone and to open their email inbox, and I tell them to open a
message and respond. But I want them to notice what's happening in their mind and body all
the time. And finally, I t
ell them to turn off their phone and put it away and ask them how they
feel.
</p><p>.Anne Smith
: What are the responses that you usually get from the people who go through this
exercise?
</p><p>.John Thomson
: Everybody has somewhat different reactions. Some people notice
that as soon
as they think about their phone, they start to get anxious and then they feel more relaxed when
they put the phone away, whereas others feel bad when they have to put it away. By doing this
exercise they begin to become aware of their own habi
ts.
</p><p>.Anne Smith
: Dr Thomson, many thanks for being with us today and for explaining how
mindfulness can help us have a healthier relationship with our mobile phones.
