            Presenter/Interviewer: UNESCO organized the World Education Forum 2015 in the
            Republic of Korea where over 1,600 participants from 160 countries adopted the
            Declaration for Education 2030. Thi
            s declaration sets out a new vision for education for
            the next fifteen years. Today with us we have Ms Ryan, an expert and researcher in
            education and one of the participants in the Forum.
            Interviewer: Good morning, Ms Ryan. And welcome to the programme.
          </p><p>.M
            s Ryan: Good morning. And thank you for inviting me
          </p><p>.Interviewer: We all know that UNESCO believes that education is a human right for all.
            So what exactly IS its aim in the next 30 years?
          </p><p>.Ms Ryan: UNESCO wants to make sure that all people get an
            inclusive,
            quality
            education. Inclusive education means that c
            hildren
            with and without disabilities
            participate and learn together in the same classes. And all children should have
            access to high quality teachers, materials, and school.
            UNESCO also wants to
            promote
            lifelong learning opportunities for all; that is, education throughout life.
            Learning does not finish when we leave school anymore.
          </p><p>.Interviewer: And why now? Hasn’t this always been important?
          </p><p>.Ms Ryan: Of course. But we are now thinking about the many skills that children will
            need in order to be successful in the 21st century: The ability to collaborate and
            work in teams, critical thinking skills, oral presentation skills, written
            communication
            skills, ability to use technology, willingness to examine civic and
            global issues, ability to conduct research to learn about issues and concepts. All
            these are basic skills that a citizen will need in twenty years’ time.
          </p><p>.Interviewer: Everybody talks a l
            ot about education. Why is education such a common
            topic in debates now?
          </p><p>.Ms Ryan:
            Our world is changing, and in order to prepare our children for this new world
            we need to change the way we educate them. We must create a curriculum that
            will help students to connect with the world and understand the issues facing
            our world
            Obviously, te
            aching in the 21
            -
            century is different; never before could
            learning occur the way in which it does now
            --
            everywhere, all the time, on any
            possible topic, supporting any possible learning style or preference.
          </p><p>.Interviewer: So, what do you think classes will
            be like in 2030?
          </p><p>.Ms Ryan: Schools in the 21st century will become a place for teachers and students to
connect with those around them and their community. Teachers in this new
environment will talk less while providing students with tools so that they can
turn information into knowledge.
</p><p>.Interviewer: I see. So, if we’re able to maintain the student's interest in the material by
showing how this knowledge applies in the real world, kids will be excited about
going to school.
</p><p>.Ms Ryan: Exactly. In this type o
f classroom, activities and lessons are directly related
to the community. Students collaborate with people from different schools and
different countries to learn about issues that affect us all.
</p><p>.Interviewer: Are you talking about reaching the whole world
? Global education?
</p><p>.Ms Ryan: Well, yes. That’s it.
</p><p>.Interviewer: So, you’re saying that schools have to make use of technology and
multimedia. Students should have full access to technology and, if possible,
every student will have a laptop.
</p><p>.Ms Ryan: Right
. The lessons are not based on textbooks, instead they are project
-
based. Skills and content are learned through research and projects, and
textbooks are just one of many possible resources. At schools, there will be
labs, learning centres, as well as stud
ios for art, music, theatre, and so on.
Each classroom will be equipped with a computer or television so that all
students can watch school productions as well as presentations from other
schools.
</p><p>.Interviewer: Do you think that textbooks will disappear?
</p><p>.Ms
Ryan: As I said, textbooks are just one of the many tools we can use in school. But
it is true that today's tools make it possible to learn about other countries and
people first
-
hand. Of course, textbooks are still necessary, yet, there is nothing
like l
earning languages, cultures, and communication skills from actually talking
to people from other parts of the world.
</p><p>.Interviewer: Sure. They are digital natives after all, aren’t they?
</p><p>.Ms Ryan: Yes. That’s true. However, t
oday's students have the latest,
greatest tools,
yet they’re only used to calling or texting with family and friends. Even though
students are now viewed as digital natives, many do not really produce digital
content. While they own expensive devices that can produce blogs,
infographics,
books, how
-
to videos, and tutorials, just to name a few, in many
classes they are asked to turn those devices off and work with printed handouts
and worksheets. Sadly, these papers are simply thrown away once graded. In
fact, if given the chance, students
can produce beautiful and creative blogs,
movies, or digital stories that they can feel proud of and share with others.
</p><p>.Interviewer: So, what’s your opinion about mobile phone use in class?
</p><p>.Ms Ryan: When students are encouraged to view their devices as val
uable tools that
support knowledge, they start using them as such. I remember my first years of
teaching when I would not allow mobile phones in class and I'd try to explain every new vocabulary word or answer each question myself; something I would
not ev
en think of doing today! I have seen positive changes ever since I started
viewing students' devices as useful aids. In fact, sometimes I even respond by
saying "I don't know
--
use Google and tell us all!" What a difference in their
reactions!
</p><p>.Interviewer
: Is there any other advantage you see in the use of these new
technologies in class?
</p><p>.Ms Ryan: Technology allows collaboration between teachers and students. Creating
digital resources, presentations, and projects together with other educators and
students
will make classroom activities resemble the real world. Collaboration
should go beyond sharing documents via e
-
mail or creating PowerPoint
presentations. Many great ideas never go beyond a conversation or paper
copy, which is a great loss! Collaboration g
lobally can change our entire
experience!
</p><p>.Interviewer: So how do you see this new school? What will it look like?
</p><p>.Ms Ryan: New schools in the 21st century will be bright and spacious, and kids will
have room for group projects and individual assignments. Walls will be hung
with student work, and there will be places for students to put on performances
for their parent
s and members of the community.
</p><p>.Interviewer: We’ve run out of time. Thank you very much for sharing your time with us.
</p><p>.Ms Ryan: My pleasure. Thank you.
