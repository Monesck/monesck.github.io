            Interviewer
            : Welcome to our weekly program about famous Americans.
            Tonight, we go
            after the story of one of the most extraordinary men
            of our time. He is Frank Lloyd
            Wright, perhaps the greatest architect of the twentieth century and certainly the most
            famous American architect ever. And in the opinion of some, America's foremost social
            rebel. So, let’s talk to Mr. Roger Wolf, Frank Lloyd
            Wright’s biographer. Mr Wolf, how
            would you define him?
          </p><p>.Mr Wolf
            : Well, I’m not the most appropriate person to define him. According to a story
            in
            Life Magazine
            not many years back, fellow architects have called him everything,
            from a great poet to an insufferable windbag. The clergy has deplored his morals,
            creditors have deplored his financial habits, politicians, his opinions. Admirers of Frank
            Lloyd Wright co
            nsider him as a man one hundred years ahead of his time. I’m an
            admirer.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : One of his most famous statements was "If I had another fifteen years to
            work, I could rebuild this entire country, I could change the nation
            .
            " Now, would you tell
            me why
            should he, one man, want to change the way of life of millions and millions of
            people?
          </p><p>.Mr Wolf
            : Well, he thought the way of life in which the country... to which the country is
            committed needs change.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : But don’t you think these words show hi
            s ego, his self
            -
            centeredness?
            You're saying that practically everyone in the United States is out of step except Frank
            Lloyd Wright.
          </p><p>.Mr Wolf
: Not at all, I’m not saying anything of the kind. It isn't their job to build, it was
his. He thought people shoul
d have a right to look to their architects for suggestions for
what they should build.
</p><p>.Interviewer
: Well, as an architect...
</p><p>.Mr Wolf
: ...and how they should build it.
</p><p>.Interviewer
: As an architect, how would he have liked to change the way that we live?
</p><p>.Mr Wolf
: He wouldn't have liked to change so much the way we live, as what we live in,
and how we live in it. Wright always said that we ourselves are changing in the
buildings we live in. Most people don't really understand what it is to live in an organi
c
building with organic character.
</p><p>.Interviewer
: Well now, organic building, organic character, these are words which are
difficult to understand
.
</p><p>.Mr Wolf
: Well, let's say natural, would that suit you better?
For Wright, a truly organic
building developed
from within outwards and was thus in harmony with its time, place,
and inhabitants.
</p><p>.Interviewer
: I'm still not... I would like specifically, to know what you mean, how would
he like to change the way that we live?
</p><p>.Mr Wolf
: He meant he'd have liked to have
a free architecture, an architecture that
belonged where you see it standing, architecture that graced the landscape instead of
being a disgrace in the landscape. His clients told him how those buildings he had built
for them had changed the character of
their whole lives and their whole existence. And
it's different now than it was before. Well, he'd have liked to do that for the whole
country.
</p><p>.Interviewer
: But, imagine New York. When he came to New York, and he saw the
skyline of New York, didn’t it exc
ite him? After all, he did design the Guggenheim
Museum in New York. Most of us think that New York is so spectacular and imposing.
</p><p>.Mr Wolf
: In fact, it didn
’
t impress him at all. Because it never was planned, it was all
the result of a race for rent, and
it is a great monument, he thought, to the power of
money and to greed. It wasn’t about ideas. He didn't see an idea in the whole thing
anywhere. Do you? Where is the idea in it? What's the idea?
</p><p>.Interviewer
: The idea is obviously, it seems to me, that a lot of people want to live
together to make their livings, to make money, to... to enjoy what this large city has to
offer. And I guess from time immemorial people have flocked more or less to one spot
to exc
hange ideas as well as goods.
</p><p>.Mr Wolf
: But there was a justification for that. When there were no other means of
communication than by personal contact. That's when the plans for the cities we now
live in originated. They originated back in the Middle Ages, when the only way you
could have a
culture, the only way you could get social distinction or any education,
was by joining other people. Today, however, we cannot get modern improvements
here in the city anymore.
</p><p>.Interviewer
: Let me see if I get your point. Is Fallingwater, Frank Lloyd Wri
ght’s most
famous work, an example of good architecture?
What
is
it
that
makes
Fallingwater
so
special?
</p><p>.Mr Wolf
: Fallingwater is Frank Lloyd Wright’s house built over a waterfall in
Pennsylvania for a rich family from Pittsburgh in the 1930s, and it’s argu
ably
the
most
famous house of the modern era. I think it’s Wright’s supreme example of architecture
connected to nature, what he called ‘organic architecture’, because the house is
integrated into the landscape. The water flows through the living room.
</p><p>.Int
erviewer:
I get it now. Let’s talk about other aspects of Wright’s personality. Wright
had faith in youth. However, he did not have faith in the mob, yet young people grow
into adults and often turn into a mob. Or do I misunderstand?
</p><p>.Mr Wolf
: I think you’
ve got it right. He believed
that
many people were not properly
educated and didn't have an opportunity to go right instead of left. He always said that
he put a capital N on Nature, and that is where people had to go, go back to Nature. He
said that when
you go out into a big forest, with towering pines, and experience a
feeling of awe, frequently you do connect with the presence of nature, you not only feel
large, you feel enlarged and encouraged, intensified, more powerful.
</p><p>.Interviewer
: It is clear in yo
ur biography that he was rebellious, a radical in his art and
life. Do you agree?
</p><p>.Mr Wolf
: Absolutely.
But do
n
’
t forget that if you ask the average citizen to name a
famous American architect, you can bet that their answer will be Frank Lloyd Wright.
Wright gained such cultural primacy for good reason: he changed the way we build and
live.
</p><p>.Interviewer
: Mr. Wolf, I thank you for talking with us today.
</p><p>.Mr Wolf
: Well, you're welcome
