            REPORTER:
            Hi, Mark. Welcome to our programme.
          </p><p>.MARK: My pleasure.
          </p><p>.REPORTER:
            To start, tell us why you are so interested in Jim Thompson.
          </p><p>.MARK: Well, learning about someone from a different era, a different background or a
            totally different set of life experiences gi
            ves you a new perspective. It
            allows you to see
            the world in new ways. Two years ago, I was in Thailand on holidays, and someone told
            me about this man. Everything about him seemed taken out of a movie. So, I started to
            investigate. I was able to find out
            many things about his life but much remained, and will
            remain, a secret forever.
          </p><p>.REPORTER: He was American, wasn’t he? So how come he is so famous in Thailand?
            Tell us a bit about his life.
          </p><p>.MARK:
            Jim Thompson was born in Delaware, in the United States. He
            was the
            youngest of five children His father was a wealthy textile manufacturer. He studiearchitecture at Princeton. He lived and worked in New York and had a comfortable life
            there. But in 1944 he quit his job and enlisted with the Delaware National Gua
            rd. In
            1949, he joined the Department of Strategic Services of the United States, what today
            we know as the CIA, to participate in different operations in the Far East. He arrived in
            Thailand shortly after the victory over Japan in World War II. After a se
            ries of
            "missions", he was finally assigned to Bangkok as head of American secret services,
            thus beginning the fabulous legend that emerges from his no less fabulous life.
          </p><p>.REPORTER: So, let me see if I got it right. He was a spy!!
          </p><p>.MARK: Exactly, notice we
            are referring to the 1940s. The Second World War had just
            ended. It’s the time of the Cold War. The United States needed information, so Thailand
            seemed like a great place to get it. However, oddly enough he is not remembered for his
            deeds as a member of
            CIA. He was a benefactor for Thai society and that is why he is
            well remembered.
          </p><p>.REPORTER: Right. He is linked to the silk industry, isn’t he? How did this relationship
            start?
          </p><p>.MARK:
            In Bangkok Thompson bought a part of the Oriental Hotel, but his great
            o
            pportunity came with the
            guild
            of silk
            spinners
            . The guild was in decline because silk
            had been relegated by the Thais themselves in favour of other, cheaper
            fabrics
            .
            Thompson was a visionary and relaunched the silk business thanks to his contacts with
            Eur
            ope. In 1948, he founded the Silk Company of Thailand.
          </p><p>.REPORTER: But wasn’t being a foreigner a huge inconvenience for him? I mean, did the
            Thais trust him? He may not have known many of their customs and ways of doing
            business.
          </p><p>.MARK: Well, at a time when
            the Thais preferred everything Western, Thompson was a
            revolutionary who recovered traditions and craftsmanship. He defended Thai art and
            architecture at all costs, but without losing his own Western roots. In fact, there was no
            party or social event of an
            y kind that Thompson did not attend. His presence was
            fundamental at any and every event, and both the Thais and the international
            community in Bangkok adored him.
          </p><p>.REPORTER: So, he was kind of a star!
          </p><p>.MARK: Yes, in fact, a
            ll the personalities that passed t
            hrough the Bangkok of those
            years sat at his table, among them his friend Truman Capote.
          </p><p>.REPORTER: I see. But tell us a bit about his mysterious disappearance. What happened?
          </p><p>.MARK: In fact, his mysterious disappearance accelerated his legend. In 1967, duri
            ng a
            vacation in Malaysia with some friends, he went for a walk and simply disappeared.
            This gave rise to speculations of all kinds: kidnapping, murder, all sorts of things.
          </p><p>.REPORTER: But people do not just disappear. I’m sure the police looked into the
            di
            sappearance.
          </p><p>.MARK: Yes, of course. But the fact is that he was never found, which only served to
forge his legend. And to put more salt on the wound, his only sister was killed in her
home in the United States soon after his disappearance and their driver
and guide in
Malaysia dropped out of sight and was never heard from again. You can see how all of
this seems to be part of a crime novel as opposed to real life. Some people say that, in
reality, he never stopped working for the CIA and that's why he left
as suddenly as he
had arrived.
</p><p>.REPORTER: Spy or not, the truth is that he left a magnificent
legacy
.
</p><p>.MARK: Definitely. Today the silk business that Thompson created is one of the main
sources of income in the country, a thriving industry that exports silk
to the whole world.
In addition, the firm has diversified and has entered the restaurant business, opening
restaurants and wine bars with all the glamour that always characterized this man of
exquisite tastes.
</p><p>.REPORTER: We are running out of time, so a las
t question. Is there a place in
Thailand where we can see his legacy?
</p><p>.MARK: Yes, absolutely. Currently you can visit his magnificent mansion, which has
been converted into a museum in Bangkok. In 1958, he began what was to be his most
important architectur
al achievement
—
the construction of a new home to display his art
objects. The house is a combination of six independent Thai
-
style
teakwood
houses
that have been reassembled in traditional Thai fashion
—
not even a single nail was
used. And the museum also h
ouses an excellent collection of Thai art that includes one
of the best collections of traditional art from around the world.
</p><p>.REPORTER: Well, Mark, it’s been a pleasure to have you here tonight.
</p><p>.MARK: Thank you for inviting me.
