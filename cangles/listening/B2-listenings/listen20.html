            Interviewer
            : We take it for g
            ranted now that washing our hands is a tool to fight
            disease. But somebody had to discover that, and most of the credit goes to a
            Hungarian doctor named Ignaz Semmelweis. How did he come to realize that
            handwashing was so important for our health? To answe
            r that, we’ve invited Dr. Diana
            Tulane, a professor of the history of medicine at Purdue University in Indiana who has
            studied Ignaz Semmelweis, to our program.
            Welcome and good morning, Prof. Tulane.
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : Good morning, and thank you for inviting
            me.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : My pleasure. How did you become interested in Ignaz? Is he famous?
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : Actually, I was interested in medicine as practiced in the 19
            th
            century,
            and Ignaz Semmelweis became an important name in medicine from that period.
          </p><p>.Intervie
            wer
            : I’m assuming he had something to do with handwashing.
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : Yes, that’s right. The history of handwashing is actually complicated, and
            it’s pretty amazing that someone discovered the importance of handwashing at a time
            when most people thought disease was caused by something like bad air.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : How can th
            e history of handwashing be complicated? It seems like a
            pretty basic thing to do.
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : Now it seems basic, but that wasn’t always so. The story begins in 1844
            in Vienna, Austria, where Ignaz worked in Vienna General hospital, which was the
            larges
            t maternity hospital in the world. As you can imagine, hospitals at that time were
            very different from what we know today. They didn’t know about germs, and hospitals
            were so crowded that it wasn’t really that rare for there to be more than one patient in
            a
            single bed. Conditions for healing were very poor. Not surprisingly, the mortality rate in
            hospitals of the time was extremely high.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : I can imagine.
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : One disease that was particularly deadly at this time was child bed fever,
            whic
            h was responsible for the death of many, many women. Women would notice
            symptoms just a few days after giving birth. Child bed fever was a particularly dramatic
            disease because it occurred at a time when people were supposed to be very happy,
            as their chil
            d had just been born, but things could go very bad for the mother in a very
            short period of time. She would start screaming because of the pain and
            go delirious
            ,
            and die a horrible death.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : How terrible. What caused this disease?
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : W
            e know now that this disease is caused by a bacterial infection, but
            that wasn’t known at the time. Remember, they didn’t know about germs.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : So what happened at the hospital in Vienna?
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : The conditions at Vienna General hospital we
            re so crowded that they
            had to divide the maternity ward into two clinics, one that was served by doctors, and
            the other that was served by midwives. Soon it became apparent that many more
            women were getting child bed fever and dying in the doctors’ clinic
            than in the
            midwives’ clinic. This was very puzzling to everyone, because doctors had more
            training than midwives, so everyone expected that doctors would be able to provide
            better care. No one understood why more women in the doctors’ clinic were dying.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : I bet it was Ignaz who solved the puzzle. And how did he do it?
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : Well, first he analyzed some of the explanations that people had already
            suggested. Many people thought that child bed fever was caused by overcrowded
            conditions, bu
            t he knew that that could not be the only factor because both the clinic
            served by doctors and the one served by midwives were equally crowded, so there was
            no difference there that would explain the difference in mortality. But he did observe
            some other d
            ifferences between the two clinics.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : Really? How did he do this?
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : He did what any good scientist would do: he set up controlled
            experiments. He had the women in one clinic give birth while lying on their sides, whilethose in the
            other clinic gave birth while lying on their backs. He then switched the
            positions for each group, but this had no effect. More of the doctors’ patients were still
            dying. Then, he noticed that in the doctors’ clinic, a priest was walking down the aisles
            ri
            nging a bell. He thought that maybe psychological terror played a role because the
            women in the doctors’ clinic knew that they were dying once they saw the priest and
            heard the bell, but that he couldn’t proof that, either.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : It sounds like this
            process took a long time.
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : Oh yes, it took him several years. Then, in 1847, his best friend Robert,
            a doctor, was accidentally cut while doing an autopsy and died soon afterwards. Ignaz
            noticed that his dying friend shared a lot of character
            istics with the women dying from
            child bed fever, so he hypothesized that they all had the same disease, and it obviously
            wasn’t only related to giving birth. He then observed that the doctors would do
            autopsies and afterward go directly to the maternity w
            ard to deliver babies. He realized
            that the disease might be caused by the contact with dead bodies.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : So, in effect, the doctors were spreading the disease from cadavers to
            mothers who had just given birth.
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : Exactly. To test his h
            ypothesis, Ignaz had the doctors wash their hands
            with a disinfectant after they performed an autopsy and before they entered the
            maternity ward. Once the doctors started doing this, the mortality rate of women in their
            clinic decreased to the same level a
            s that in the midwives’ clinic.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : So, did Ignaz become a hero? It sounds like he saved a lot of women’s
            lives.
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : Well, yes and no. At first, the medical community was skeptical. Most of
            the doctors agreed to his idea of handwashing,
            but Ignaz was not an easy person to
            work with. For example, he insisted that all cases of child bed fever were caused by
            contamination from autopsies, even when that really wasn’t possible. In the end, he
            was taken to a psychiatric hospital and died alone.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : How sad! But his realization that handwashing could prevent the spread
            of disease turned out to be very important.
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            : Yes. At about the same time as his death, scientists discovered that
            germs cause disease, and that would not have
            happened without the work of people
            like Ignaz Semmelweis.
          </p><p>.Interviewer
            : That’s all we have time for today. Thank you, Dr. Tulane, for this very
            interesting history of handwashing.
          </p><p>.Prof. Tulane
            . Thank you.
