          <p>.Reporter:
            Each year at this time since 2009, tennis player Chris Jules has been
            coming to New York
            City
            and leaving with the U.S. Open trophy. Jules, who is 33 and
            among the top tennis practitioners, has no immediate plans to retire. Last August he
            won the Western Open title and was in the semifinals in Wimbledon in July. In
            November he was in the London Ma
            sters final. In today’s program he’s interviewed by
            our sports reporter.
            Now listen to the rest of the interview.
          </p><p>.Reporter:
            Good evening, Chris. Welcome to our program.
          </p><p>. Jules:
            Good evening. Thank you for inviting me!
          </p><p>.Reporter
            :
            First of all, Chris, how does
            it feel being a world champion, again?
          </p><p>. Jules:
            Well, I’m great! I’m feeling so much better than I did last year. But hearing you
            say I’ve been coming to New York since 2009, I can’t believe how old I am. Time really
            flies. But I’m feeling in great shape.
          </p><p>.R
            eporter
            :
            Being a tennis champion means you must do a lot of travelling. How do you
            manage personal life and competition?
          </p><p>.Jules:
            I love being in the tennis court but I am also happy to go back home in Austria,
            where I can
            catch up with
            friends and family ..
            . although my wife and I also love it
            when it’s time to pack things up and travel abroad. We always see its positive side,
            even though leaving our kids behind is hard.
          </p><p>.Reporter
            :
            Tennis is your life and your passion, but has it always been like that? The
            di
            scipline of
            practice
            and the tournaments and championships, don’t you ever feel it’s
            too much?
          </p><p>.Jules:
            In my early years I had to struggle. There were times when I got bored after 45
            minutes of practice; I wasn’t enjoying tennis so much. That must have bee
            n when I was
            between 16 and 21 and there were so many of these moments that I nearly gave up.
            One day I said to my coach, “I’m fed up with this, I want to become professional”. And
            so I did, and then I started to really enjoy tennis practice. Today I love
            practice; in fact
            my favorite time is when nobody's watching. When there's a crowd, I feel the pressure
            of the people watching, taking pictures, analyzing me.... I know it may sound
            odd
            ,
            because I also enjoy the competition, and it’s great when people are ch
            eering and
            celebrating a good serve.
          </p><p>.Reporter
            :
            You once told me you don’t like being alone. Has that changed?
          </p><p>.Jules:
Not really.
I love having people around. When we’re at home, our house is
always open; friends and family come in and out all the time. My wife travels with me
most of the times but if she can’t, well, it feels
odd
not having her with me. I remember
when I went to Bar
celona by myself last year. I got back to my room after the match
and there was nobody there. I felt pretty lonely. My family, my wife and my twin
daughters, are really important to me. If we can, we are always together. But, of
course, the kids have to go
to school; so sometimes that’s not possible.
</p><p>.Reporter
:
Let’s talk about tennis now. What has been the biggest change in tennis
these last 10 years?
</p><p>.Jules:
The game has evolved. The way we play tennis today has changed a lot,
probably because of racket te
chnology. Maybe it’s not so much fun sometimes as it
used to be. Ten years ago tennis players were aggressive in the sense that they would
play from the back of the court and also from the front. Nowadays most tennis players
play from the back. I prefer th
e way tennis was played before.
</p><p>.Reporter
:
But if I ask you what’s the biggest change in YOUR life, what would you
say?
</p><p>.Jules:
The biggest change for me has probably been
social media
.
</p><p>.Reporter
:
You really seem to have taken to it!
</p><p>.Jules:
Yeah, but it took me a while. I started with Facebook: downloading a few
pictures and making comments. That was my slow introduction into the
social
network.
Then last year it was Twitter. Everybody uses social media differently. I said
to myself, "If I am
going to do it, I’ll do it my own way!" My idea was to give people the
extra
insight
into tennis nobody else has. Give them something they didn’t know. So
I’m not publishing game results or other things that people may learn from the news.
I’m giving them
my feelings, my thoughts. And I’m glad about it since people say they
like what I’m doing. I think it’s been actually quite nice.
</p><p>.Reporter
:
Apart from tennis, your family and networking, what other things do you
enjoy doing?
</p><p>.Jules:
In my leisure time, I love meeting up with friends for coffee. And since I live this
busy life, when I'm on vacation my favorite place is going to the beach; just listening to
the waves on a solitary, quiet beach.
</p><p>.Reporter
:
What’s one thing you’re really
looking forward to when you’re not playing
tennis? Other sports, perhaps?
</p><p>.Jules:
I had to stop playing other sports because I'm too scared I might get injured. I
used to play squash, badminton, basketball and soccer. So maybe I’ll play them again
in the f
uture. And of course skiing; can you imagine living in Austria and not skiing?
</p><p>.Reporter
:
Well, Jules, I’m afraid we’ve run out of time. Thank you very much for your
time.
</p><p>.Jules
: My pleasure
