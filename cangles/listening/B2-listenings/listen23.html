            Paul Smith:
            This is
            Science Today
            . Welcome! The spacecraft InSight
            successfully
            landed on the surface of Mars a few weeks ago, just as other spacecraft had done in
            previous missions, but it is different this time. Today, Dr Susan Halliday, a scientist
            working for the InSight mission for NASA is with us and will help us f
            ind out why this
            mission is different from previous ones.
          </p><p>.Paul:
            We've had a lot of spacecraft go to Mars. What's unique about this mission?
          </p><p>.Dr Halliday
            :
            We have had many missions that have looked at the surface of Mars, but
            we are the first one that is rea
            lly going to tell us about the interior of Mars and its
            several layers, how all those layers got there. We will learn about the geologic activity
            that could have created a habitat that may have supported life early in Mars's history.
          </p><p>.Paul:
            And why do we wa
            nt to know that?
          </p><p>.Dr Halliday
            :
            Well, what we are really aiming for, our big
            -
            picture scientific question is
            what happens in the first tens of millions of years after a planet forms. We know from
            investigations of volcanoes on Earth that all the rocky bodies
            go through this process of
            separating into different layers, but we don’t know much about how that process really
            works. Our mission will help us gain a better understanding of this process.
          </p><p>.Paul:
            Can you tell me a little bit about the craft?
          </p><p>.Dr Halliday
            :
            Sure, it's the InSight Lander. Lander crafts don’t have wheels. We actually
            need to stay in one place and be as quiet as possible so that we can use our
            instruments to detect Mars quakes. In fact
            ,
            we put those instruments underground. This
            is extremely imp
            ortant to us. The first mission that landed on Mars, Viking, actually had
            a seismometer that stayed on the craft. So it detected the gusts of wind that made the
            craft shake, but it could not detect quakes precisely at all.
          </p><p>.Paul:
            I see, so the InSight
            also has a seismometer?
          </p><p>.Dr Halliday
:
Yes, that’s right, but for the first time we're going to place it on the ground.
The only other place where this has been done besides Earth is on the Moon. The
Apollo astronauts actually
drilled
holes in
to
the Moon to
place some instruments
underground. But now we are going to do all those things robotically. We use a robotic
arm to put the seismometer in the ground and then place a wind shield on top of the
seismometer to protect it from wind gusts that could be mista
ken for seismic waves.
</p><p>.Paul:
And how do you decide on the landing location? Can you determine a location
precisely?
</p><p>.Dr Halliday
:
Yes, we can be very precise about the location. In fact, we chose a
specific area where there is a certain elevation for safety reasons. The atmosphere of
Mars is very thin, so we need to have enough atmosphere to slow us down so that we
can land. And bec
ause the InSight is powered by solar energy
,
we need to be near the
equator. And then, lastly, we don't want our spacecraft to land on rocks or to have
rocks under the surface we want to
drill
. We went for the flattest, safest, most boring
landing site eve
r on Mars, we were not interested in exploring the geology of various
areas
,
as previous missions had done.
</p><p>.Paul:
When the Curiosity spacecraft landed on Mars about six years ago, the landing
was described as the seven minutes of terror. Is it less risky n
ow?
</p><p>.Dr Halliday
:
Well, not really. Every time you land on Mars it's always very risky. When
it works
,
it looks smooth and easy, but
,
in fact
,
at least a third of the missions that have
been sent to Mars have failed.
</p><p>.Paul:
And how is the landing achieved?
</p><p>.Dr Halliday
:
Well, first we need a heat shield
,
because we are going
at
12,300 miles
per hour when we hit the atmosphere of Mars. This slows down the craft quite a bit.
Then, when it is pretty near the surface
,
the parachute is released. This makes the cra
ft
go quite slowly, and finally, in the last one hundred meters or so we remove the
parachute and we
come down on
landing rockets. And so if everything goes well
,
it's
quite a gentle touchdown.
</p><p>.Paul:
But it's still a precision landing really, isn't it?
</p><p>.Sus
an:
It is, and it's all automated. Because of the one
-
way flight time to Mars,
we
can't command anything when
this is happening, we just have to rely on getting the
sequence of commands correct in advance and we just sit in the control room and wait
to hea
r back.
</p><p>.Paul:
So
,
now that the landing was successful, what happens next?
</p><p>.Dr Halliday
:
Our initial mission lasts one Mars year, that is, two Earth years. The first
thing we are going to do is spend a few months choosing the right place to put our
instrumen
ts down in the ground. So it will be a while before we actually start acquiring
data.
</p><p>.Paul:
I am sure that data must be very interesting and revealing.
</p><p>.Dr Halliday
:
We hope so.
</p><p>.Paul:
I’m
afraid we’ve run out of time. Many thanks for talking to us about the InSight
mission.
</p><p>.Dr Halliday
:
My pleasure.
