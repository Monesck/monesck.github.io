            Mary:
            Welcome to our radio show
            Celebrities
            , today we have a very special guest. I'm
            very pleased to welcome onto the show now, um, oh, what do I call you? Do I call you
            Stephen, or Steve, or David?
          </p><p>.Steve:
            Steve. Please call me Steve.
          </p><p>.Mary:
            It's Steve Spencer, or David Jones. Star of detective David Jones films. Thanks
            for coming in today.
          </p><p>.Steve:
            It's a pleasure... God... it's fantastic to be here today.
          </p><p>.Mary:
            I am surprised to see that you look a little bit nervous...
          </p><p>.Steve:
            No, I'm just really excited because I'm, I... I mean, I've never done an interview
            in a radio station before!
          </p><p>.Mary:
            Really? Well that’s exciting. Can I start by asking you about your last film? Is this
            your favourite so far?
          </p><p>.Steve:
            I don't think you'll be disappointed. It's really good, I've seen the film twice now,
            the full, finished version, and it's really, really amazing. It's really sophisticated, it's
            brilliant. It's really... it's quite
            scary
            , in parts, I mean... I knew what was coming and I
            still jumped all the time! It’s quite different from the other films.
          </p><p>.Mary:
            And what about
            stunts
            ? We’ve heard you like doing your own
            stunts
            , don't
            you?
          </p><p>.Steve:
            It's just fun! I like doing most of them... but, obviously, if something's really
            really... like, if I'm incapable of doing something, then obviously I won't do it, because
            I'll probably just kill myself! So... yeah, I like to do as many as is possible.
          </p><p>.Mary:
            So, which were the really good ones? Which were the most extreme? Could you
            tell us about a nice scary one?
          </p><p>.Steve:
            On my latest film, for example, I had to do this thing where I was climbing up
            the face of this huge statue, I was on a
            wire,
            and I had to do all the climbing, and that
            was really fun, and there were lots of sword fights, so it was a bit dangerous but it was
            really great.
          </p><p>.Mary:
Have you ever had any great
bruise
s, or injuries?
</p><p>.Steve:
Not really... I hope to get maybe a few battle
scars
on the film I am working on
at the moment.
</p><p>.Mary:
Right, we want you to tell us a bit about your director in this film. There was a
story that the new director got each one of the actors and actresses to write essays
about your characters.
</p><p>.Steve:
Yeah, and that kind of revealed to us how much like our characters we are, and
it terrified us, I think.
Because... for example, in the film David, at his office, kind of
does the work, but he doesn't really do any great work, he doesn’t do much in fact, he
doesn’t like being in his office doing paperwork. So, I wrote just a few lines on a page,
which was what David would have done. So, writing about my character was
interesting but it was bit scary.
</p><p>.Mary:
In this film Michael Goodman plays Jonathan Black, a serial killer. What was it
like, working with him?
</p><p>.Steve:
He's amazing! He's the coolest guy. We talked a lot about music. He's really big
on music, really big on The Beatles and loads of other really cool bands.
</p><p>.Mary:
Really? Can I ask you what kind of music you like? We’ve heard you're a major
music fan, is this true?
</p><p>.Steve:
Yeah
,
I love music.
</p><p>.Mary:
Do you get to go to see any concerts?
</p><p>.Steve:
Not as much as I'd like to, but I'm seeing the Chilli Peppers in Hyde Park. I'm
going to that, I’m very excited, because The Drixies are supporting, but my first concert
was The Strikes last year, in December, which was really good fun.
</p><p>.Mary:
So when did you come across The Drixies?
</p><p>.Steve:
Um... I bought a compilation of film soundtracks, and the song
"The name of my
soul"
was on there, because it's part of the soundtrack to the film
Fight Club
, and so I
went out and bought their greatest hits record
The Drixies
, and from there, I just, kind
of, became obsessed, basically.
</p><p>.Mary:
Completely obsessed.
</p><p>.Steve:
Yeah.
</p><p>.Mary:
And what about music festivals? Are you going to any?
</p><p>.Steve:
Oh, I would love to..., but I don't... it's just... because I'm filming all the time,
there's just no time at the moment. But soon, I'm hopefully going to get time to start
going to some more concerts and music festivals, definitely.

</p><p>.Mary:
If you ever got fed up and stopped acting, what would you do?
</p><p>.Steve:
I'd actually like to be in a band.
</p><p>.Mary:
Really?
</p><p>.Steve:
I know that probably sounds really
weird
, because I'm here as an actor, but I
actually would love to do it.
</p><p>.Mary:
What instrument would you play?
</p><p>.Steve:
Well, I'd like to sing. But, I kind of play a little bit of guitar, as well. I'm kind of
getting there, but slowly.
</p><p>.Mary:
Gosh, Steve, we are running out of time. Thank you very much for talking to us
today.
</p><p>.Steve:
Thank you very much indeed
