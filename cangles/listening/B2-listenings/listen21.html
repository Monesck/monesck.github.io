            Interviewer: The
            Paralympic Games
            are a series of international
            multi
            -
            sport
            events
            involving athletes with different
            disabilities
            . What you may not know is that there
            is one sport played in the Paralympics which does not have an Olympics counterpart:
            goalball. My guest today is Chloe Thompson, and she is here to tell us what makes
            goalb
            all unique. She is a goalball player on the American team.
            Welcome to our programme, Chloe. I must say I’ve never heard of goalball. Can you
            tell us a little bit about this sport, and what makes it unique?
          </p><p>.Chloe: Sure, and thank you for inviting me to your
            programme. Goalball is the only
            sport played in the Paralympics that has not been adapted from another sport. It was
            created on its own, specifically for people who have low vision or who are blind. It was
            invented in the 1940s by two doctors to help with
            the rehabilitation of soldiers who had
            been blinded in the Second World War, and developed as a competitive sport in the
            1950s and 1960s. Today goalball is played in over 100 countries around the world. The
            game has a large following in these countries an
            d is played both for enjoyment as well
            as a rehabilitation technique for children who are born blind and for anyone who loses
            their sight later
            in life. It was first played in
            the Paralympics unofficially in 1972, and in
            1976 it became an official Paralymp
            ic sport.
          </p><p>.Interviewer: What kind of court is it played on?
          </p><p>.Chloe: Goalball is played on a court that is the same size as a volleyball court. It is 18
            meters long by 9 meters wide and all of the lines that are on the floor are both painted
            and tactile so th
            at the players can feel them with their hands and feet as they play.
          </p><p>.Interviewer: Why do the lines on the floor have to be painted, if all the players rely on
            their sense of touch to feel them?
          </p><p>.Chloe: Goalball has referees, like other competitive sports, a
            nd they need to see the
            lines. In fact, there are nine officials on court during official competitions.
          </p><p>.Interviewer: Of course. Could you tell us a bit about the game itself? How long does a
            game take, and how do you score points?
          </p><p>.Chloe: A goalball game c
            onsists of two 12
            -
            minute halves with a 3
            -
            minute halftime in
            which the players switch ends of the court, so each game lasts about half an hour.
            There are two teams, and there is a maximum of six players on each team, and there
            are three players from each te
            am on the court at any single time. Players try to defend
            their goal from throws of a ball from the other end of the court. So, the object of the
            game is to score goals by getting the ball past the opposing team and across the goal
            line, and to do this you
            either throw the ball or roll it on the ground. The ball is about the
            size of a basketball and it weighs just under three pounds.
          </p><p>.Interviewer: So you either throw or roll the ball. Can you also kick it?
          </p><p>.Chloe: No, players are not allowed to kick the ball
            .
          </p><p>.Interviewer: This may sound like a silly question, but how do you know where the ball is
            if you can't see it?
          </p><p>.Chloe: The ball has bells inside of it so that it can be heard when it's being thrown or
            when it’s rolling. So for the players it's very importa
            nt for the crowd to keep quiet while
            the ball is in play because otherwise we can’t hear it. The coaches must also stay silent
            during gameplay. In fact, silence is so important that if players on the offense make too
            much noise while they are throwing or r
            olling the ball, they can be penalized because
            the team defending its goal might not be able to hear the ball.
          </p><p>.Interviewer: Is this sport only for people who are totally blind?
          </p><p>.Chloe: No. Some players are totally blind and some have low vision. Because of
            the
            varying degrees of visual impairment of the athletes, we are all required to wear
            eyeshades that completely black out our vision, so that everybody on court, in effect,
            plays blind.
          </p><p>.Interviewer: Tell us a little bit about your last goalball game.
          </p><p>.Chl
            oe: It was great! We played in San Francisco. One of the referees punished me with
            a penalty because I touched my eyeshades, which is not allowed, so I had to defend
            the entire goal on my own. I was nervous and could feel the tense atmosphere in the
            audien
            ce. But in the end, we won!
          </p><p>.Interviewer: I can tell you’re very enthusiastic about goalball Why do you like playing so
            much?
          </p><p>. Chloe: To me, my team is like a family. I love the unity that we have. We are really
            good
            friends and rely on each other. Apart from that, this sport improves my orientation
            skills and builds confidence, which helps me in lots of ways. I also like the
            competitiveness of the game. It's really great fun!
          </p><p>. Interviewer: Thank you, Chloe, for such a
            lovely introduction to this sport. We hope to
            see you on court very soon, although now we know we won't be allowed to shout each
            time you touch the ball. I’m looking forward to seeing your next match!
          </p><p>.Chloe: Thank you!
