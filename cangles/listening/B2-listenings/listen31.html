         <p>.Reporter:
            We
            are
            here
            today
            with
            Cliff
            Dorfman,
            who
            is
            many
            things:
            actor,
            film
            director,
            scriptwriter,
            teacher...
            Today
            we
            want
            to
            talk
            to
            him
            about
            his
            writing.
            Good
            evening,
            Cliff.
          </p><p>. Cliff
            Dorfman:
            Good
            evening!
          </p><p>.Reporter:
            Let’s start at the very beginning.
            What is the first story you ever wrote?
          </p><p>.Cliff
            Dorfman:
            You’ll
            be
            surprised...
            my
            first
            story
            was
            the beginning of a novel which I
            wrote when I was around 11 years old. I handwrote at least 50
            pages on a notebook
            that I kept inside my desk drawer in my bedroom. Somehow, though, it got lost. I have
            no idea what happened to it.
          </p><p>.Reporter:
            That’s
            a
            pity!
            Growing up, what movies or stories inspired your creativity?
          </p><p>. Cliff
            Dorfman:
            From early on it was Greek mythology. I was, and still am in a lot of
            ways, obsessed with it. Then I moved to classic literature (Shakespeare, Dickens, to
            name a couple) and then films, especially American films.
          </p><p>.Reporter:
            What about modern literature? I
            t doesn’t inspire you?
          </p><p>.Cliff Dorfman:
            I have to admit that I don’t read anything “modern”...
          </p><p>.Reporter:
            Imagine that you were not a well
            -
            known writer, how would you make
            directors and producers read your screenplay?
          </p><p>.Cliff
            Dorfman:
            Well, I have never had an
            y problems with that myself, so I don’t really
            know what to say. However, some friends of mine have told me how they do it.
          </p><p>.Reporter:
            So, how do they do it?
          </p><p>. Cliff
            Dorman:
            Well, according to them, you must follow the work of other writers and
            directors th
            at you find interesting. Then get in touch with them through the Internet. In
            this digital age, it’s easier than ever to contact people: e
            -
            mail, webpages, Facebook,
            Twitter... Once you’ve made contact, you can send them your script directly.
          </p><p>.Reporter:
            What
            experiences from your life influence your characters?
          </p><p>.Cliff
Dorfman:
Every single one. Every person I know, have ever known or even
run
into
for an instant. Every experience I’ve ever had. My family. My friends. My
relationships. Everything. I sit around
public places and listen to other people’s
conversations. If they interest me, I sometimes record them or write down things they
say.
</p><p>.Reporter:
How emotionally involved are you with the characters you create?
</p><p>.Cliff
Dorfman:
Oh, they live with me the enti
re time I’m writing them. I can be out with
friends, at a dinner, on a date and I’m sitting there thinking to myself, well, how would
my character react now? They’re all around me except when I sleep, fortunately!
</p><p>.Reporter:
What is the most important
aspect of building a great character?
</p><p>.Cliff
Dorfman:
Many things: life experience, including
weird
eating habits.
Physical
aspects are also extremely important. We are constantly doing things with our bodies
that reflect the way that we feel and what we think.
</p><p>.Reporter:
Do you write an outline before you actually start writing?
</p><p>.Cliff
Dorfman:
Sometimes. I don’t par
ticularly like doing it, but certain stories
demand
it.
</p><p>.Reporter:
Now I’d like to ask you about your favourite films. What type of structure do
these films usually have?
</p><p>.Cliff
Dorfman:
They completely vary. The structure in
Goodfellas
is one I love: inst
ead
of starting at the beginning and going until the end, it starts in the middle, and goes
backwards and forwards. Very interesting. But the film I love the most, though, is
Pulp
Fiction
. Brilliant...
</p><p>.Reporter:
During the writing process, do you ever find
that your characters start to
speak for themselves?
</p><p>.Cliff
Dorfman:
Always. If they don’t speak for themselves, then I’m sure I’ve done
something wrong.
</p><p>.Reporter:
Does dialogue come easily, or is it difficult for you?
</p><p>.Cliff
Dorfman:
No!
None of it comes
easily. It’s all painful. Everything in writing a script
is very, very hard.
</p><p>.Reporter:
What about your daily routine when you’re writing? Do you have one?
</p><p>.Cliff
Dorfman:
Working out
is a huge part of it. I do boxing and yoga. I go to the gym,
but I’m not very fond of jogging. Other things that also help are putting my phone away,
turning it off and leaving it in another room.
</p><p>.Reporter:
Have
you
ever
experienced
writer’s
block?
That
is,
have
you
ever
found
yourself
totally
unable
to
write?
</p><p>.Cliff
Dorfman:
Oh
yes!
I
think
it
happens
to
all
writers,
and
it’s
really
awful!
You
sit
in
front
of
the
computer,
hour
after
hour,
and
you
don’t
write
a
single
word.
Very
frustrating.
Very
depressing.
</p><p>.Reporter:
And
so,
how
did
you
overcome
it?
</p><p>.Cliff
Dorfman:
Well,
I
have
to
admit
that
I’ve
tried
a
lot
of
things:
keeping
a
strict
routine,
meditation,
writing
on
paper,
using
a
notebook,
working
with
colleagues.
Finally,
what
worked
for
me
wa
s
camping
a
few
days
alone
in
the
woods.
When
I
came
back,
I
could
write
again.
</p><p>.Reporter:
Interesting!
Screenwriting
is
obviously
a
solitary
job.
How
do
you
deal
with
it?
Is
it
hard
to
be
alone
so
much?
</p><p>.Cliff
Dorfman:
As
a
matter
of
fact,
I
like
being
alone
and
working
alone,
although
it
can
get
hard
sometimes.
When
you
work
in
an
office,
you
can
discuss
things
with
people,
or
even
get
mad
at
them.
When
you
work
alone,
you
have
to
do
all
these
things
with
yourself!
But
it’s
not
really
a
problem
for
me.
</p><p>.Reporter:
Well,
I’m
glad
to
hear
that,
Cliff.
Thank
you
very
much
for
the
interview.
</p><p>.Cliff
Dorfman:
You’re
welcome!
