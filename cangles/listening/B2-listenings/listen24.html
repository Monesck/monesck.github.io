            Journalist: Today everyone is talking about climate change and its negative effects on
            our planet. In recent years, natural events such as huge forest fires, severe droughts
            and major hurricanes have made people around the world more aware of the
            importan
            ce of our environment. To talk about these and other issues, today we’ve
            invited Dr. Robert Thomas from Australian National University to our program.
            Welcome, Dr. Thomas.
          </p><p>.Dr. Thomas: Thank you. Happy to be here.
          </p><p>.Journalist: What can you tell us about the
            effects of climate change in Australia, Dr.
            Thomas?
          </p><p>.Dr. Thomas: Climate change is affecting the amount of rain in the country. Simply put,
            it rains less. Right now one of the major issues in Australia is the shortage of water in
            the outback, the central pa
            rt of the country that is quite a distance from the coastline
            cities where most Australians live. In the outback, there are more than a dozen towns
            without a reliable source of water.
          </p><p>.Journalist: Oh, I didn’t know that.
          </p><p>.Dr. Thomas: In the past few years, there has been a severe drought in Australia. Most
            people don’t realize that Australia is the world’s most arid continent. Rivers and lakes
            are disappearing, so people are beginning to fear that many of the rural areas in
            the
            middle of the country may have to be abandoned.
          </p><p>.Journalist: Is the lack of water only a result of climate change?
          </p><p>.Dr. Thomas: Not exactly. In addition to severe drought in recent years that IS related to
            climate change, the government approved mining
            projects that depended on an
            intensive use of water. Tourism in the outback has been promoted for years, and the population there is growing. More mining and more people mean more pressure on
            water resources.
          </p><p>.Journalist: So there has been a combination o
            f factors involved.
          </p><p>. Dr. Thomas: That’s right. Besides the new mines and the growing number of people,
            the country has not invested enough money to prepare for its future water needs.
            Australia is behind countries like the United States and China in prepar
            ing for the
            future. And the sad part is, the future is now. It rains less in Australia than it did before,
            so the rivers are drying up. And every year there are huge forest fires that are
            uncontrollable.
          </p><p>.Journalist: What are people going to do?
          </p><p>.Dr. Thomas:
            Well, actually a lot of the farmers in the outback are giving up. Many have
            decided not to plant any crops on their land and are selling all their livestock. They are
            moving away. And the towns that developed to serve the farmers and ranchers will
            probabl
            y be abandoned. Those towns depend on the business created by the farmers,
            and the farmers depend on access to water. With no water, whole towns will probably
            disappear.
          </p><p>.Journalist: It’s surprising that nothing can be done. Can’t they dig wells? I know tha
            t
            some deserts do have underground water.
          </p><p>.Dr. Thomas: In some places, wells already supply part of the drinking water. Many
            towns want to dig new wells. But digging wells is not a permanent solution to the
            problem.
          </p><p>.Journalist: Why not?
          </p><p>.Dr. Thomas: Because
            the water underground is not high quality water for drinking. It
            often has a metallic taste, and there have been some studies to suggest that it is
            responsible for some long
            -
            term health problems like high blood pressure. This water
            has to be treated, and w
            ater treatment plants in the outback are expensive and harmful
            to the environment.
          </p><p>.Journalist: Is the situation as bad in Australia’s big cities, like Sydney and Melbourne?
          </p><p>.Dr. Thomas: No, the situation in coastal areas like Sydney and Melbourne is better
            but
            not without problems. Both cities restrict the amount of water people can use. In
            Sydney the government has hired “water officers” to educate the public and enforce
            water restrictions.
          </p><p>.Journalist: How about using sea water, like they do in other parts
            of the world?
            Australia obviously has easy access to oceans.
          </p><p>.Dr. Thomas: We do use ocean water. The coastal areas have desalination plants,
            which are crucial to Australia’s water supply. Desalination plants, however, also create
            some environmental problems
            because they require a lot of energy to operate and the
            salt they remove from the water is dumped back into the oceans, which is not good for
            fish and other sea
            -
            living creatures. But the fact is these plants are necessary for
            Australia.
          </p><p>.Journalist: Can wa
            ter be recycled? I know that in some places in the U.S. recycled
            water is used to clean streets, for example.
          </p><p>.Dr. Thomas: Yes, recycling water is important now and will become even more
important in the future. Recycled water is often used to water parks i
n cities. There are
other things that can be done, too. For example, fire stations are studying how to use
sand, instead of water, to put out fires. Gardens can have artificial lawns, as opposed
to grass. We still don’t know the long
-
term results of climat
e change, but it is clear that
no matter what, Australia must plan for its future water needs.
</p><p>.Journalist: That’s all we have time for today. Thank you, Dr. Thomas, for joining us
today.
</p><p>.Dr. Thomas: My pleasure.
