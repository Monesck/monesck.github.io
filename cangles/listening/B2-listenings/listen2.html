            <p>Journalist:
              Among the many stories that Kenya hides, one of the most interesting is that lived
              by Kateren Blixen, the Danish writer who published some of the most beautiful
              stories of the twentieth century under the name of Isak
              Dinesen. However, it was in
              1985 when the film directed by Sydney Pollack, Out of Africa, starring Meryl Streep
              and Robert Redford, brought her universal fame. But today we are not here to talk
              about the film but rather about the woman Karen Blixen. And to do so, we have
              here with us, Professor Jensen from the University of Copenhagen, who has just
              published Blixen’s biography. Good morning, Dr Jensen.
              </p>
              <p>Dr Jensen:
              Good morning. A pleasure to be here.
              </p>
              <p>Journalist:
              Professor Jensen, Blixen did not like being interviewed. Where did you find the
              information you needed to write her biography?
              </p>
              <p>Dr Jensen:
              You’re right. In 1957 when she was interviewed in
              The New York Times Book
              Review
              , she said that interviews are like medical examinations and, who can feel
              inspired
              when he is being examined!
              </p>
              <p>Journalist:
              Funny way of describing an interview!
              </p>
              <p>Dr Jensen:
              Yeah, but ... in fact, she did give many interviews.
              </p>
              <p>Journalist:
              So, did you get information about her life there?
              </p>
              <p>Dr Jensen:
              Not really. The interviews shed light on Karen Blixen’s personality, literary interests
              and her view of Africa. She did not talk a lot about her private life. In the interviews,
              she commented on a number of social issues and values, as well as more general
              aspects of her storytelling.
              </p>
              <p>Journalist:
              OK. Tell us something about her life. We all know about her life in Kenya and her
              love affair with an aristocratic hunter because of the film “Out of Africa”. But how
              much of what we see in the film is real?
              </p>
              <p>Dr Jensen:
              The film is based on Blixen’s life in
              Kenya but, in my opinion, the film has become
              a classic because the safaris, the biplane and the epic scenery captured the
              imagination of cinema audiences all over the world.
              </p>
              <p>Journalist:
              I see. So, let’s look at Blixen’s life. She was Danish and the daughter of a wealthy
              politician. Why did she go to Kenya?
              </p>
              <p>Dr Jensen:
              Marriage.
              In 1913, when she was 28 years old, she left Denmark and her childhood
              home, and embarked on the journey to Africa, where she married a Swedish Baron
              named Bror Blixen-Finecke
              and began a new life on a coffee farm in Kenya. Their
              families gave them money to start the coffee farm but in
              August that year the First
              World War broke out
              and
              spread to Africa. This had consequences for the Blixens:
              there was a shortage of both workers and supplies for the farms. Even more, in
              1917 the British banned the importation of coffee. On top of this, Kenya was hit by
              a plague in cattle and by catastrophic spells of drought. The difficult conditions
              were eve
              n worse because Blixen’s husband started hazardous projects, which led
              to debts. They lost a lot of money. To make matters worse, Karen became very ill.
              She was diagnosed as having syphilis and had to go back to Denmark to be
              treated. So that meant more sp
              ending.</p>

              <p>Journalist: So, I imagine those were hard times for them.
                Dr Jensen:
                Sure, they were. But Karen was happy at that time because she met the English
                aristocrat Denys Finch Hatton, who was a safari leader in Kenya. The meeting led
                to the start of a long love affair, the nature of which is very apparent in Karen
                Blixen’s
                Out of Africa.
                </p>
                <p>Journalist:
                And what happened to the coffee farm? And her husband?
                Dr Jensen:
                Well, the board of directors of the farm fired her husband and Karen took over the
                running
                of the coffee farm. On top of that, in 1925 they got divorced.
                </p>
                <p>Journalist:
                So, did she manage to make a living out of the farm together with Finch Hatton?
                Dr Jensen:
                On the contrary. Karen did not succeed in straightening out the farm’s hopeless
                financial
                situation, and in 1931 the board of directors ran out of patience and the
                farm was sold at auction. Karen had to get ready to leave Africa. At this point she
                was ready for a change because a few months earlier, Denys Finch Hatton died
                when his private plane
                crashed.
                </p>
                <p>Journalist:
                Ohhh. So, she went back to Denmark.
                Dr Jensen:
                Exactly: In 1931, 46
                -
                year
                -
                old Karen Blixen, now financially ruined, moved in with
                her mother in Denmark.
                </p>
                <p>Journalist:
                And that was when that she started writing?
                Dr Jensen:
                Well, not exactly. Many great artists and writers show a desire during childhood
                and early youth to express themselves in the form of poems, little stories and
                sketches. This was also true of Karen. At 8, she wrote poems, fairy tales, stories
                and plays.
                In 1907 and 1909
                , before her marriage, some of her short stories were
                published under the pseudonym “Osceola” in two of the leading literary periodicals
                of the time, but they received no particular attention. But in 1913, when she
                became engaged to the Swedish baron, she
                gave up all thoughts of an artistic
                career. In a letter written to her brother, she explains that she did it to follow the
                convention of the time: women were destined for marriage and family life.
                </p>
                <p>Journalist:
                So, she gave up writing when she was in Kenya
                and started writing again when
                back in Denmark?
                Dr Jensen:
                Yes and no. She started writing in Africa around 1925, when her problems had
                begun piling up. But yes, it was when her life changed radically that she was
                obliged to find a new purpose in life and
                a new occupation, so she set out to finish
                the stories. In
                1934,
                Seven Gothic Tales
                was published under the pseudonym “Isak
                Dinesen” and in 1937
                Out of Africa
                made Karen Blixen’s name a modern classic.
                </p>
                <p>Journalist:
                She did not have an easy life but, at least, she was aware of her literary success.
                Dr Jensen:
                Yes, that’s right. She was a strong woman with extremely fragile health. By the
                time she died in 1962, she had had several health breakdowns including severe
                operations which left her an invalid and unable to eat. However, when her health
                allowed, she gathered enough strength to visit different countries to receive prizes
                or to give talks on her books.</p>
                <p>
                  Journalist:
                       What an extraordinary woman! Thanks, Dr Jensen for giving us an insight into her fascinating life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dr Jensen:
                  My pleasure.
                </p>
