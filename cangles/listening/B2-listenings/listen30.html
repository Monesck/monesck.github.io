            Antony:
            Hello, welcome to
            Future Tense
            . I have to confess it's been years since I've
            hand
            -
            written a letter or even sent a Christmas card. In today’s programme, we put the
            question “Does
            handwriting have a future?” to our expert, Professor Anne Downey.
          </p><p>.Anne
            : It's a very interesting question. Today we have many alternative ways of
            recording our thoughts and of communicating. So, in a way, younger generations don’t use handwriting in the way
            perhaps we did a generation ago or, even sometimes, they
            don’t use handwriting at all.
          </p><p>.Antony:
            What do you mean by that?
          </p><p>.Anne:
            I mean that they text or they type but usually they text. So they particularly don't
            use handwriting at all anymore. In fact, I
            would say that for the day
            -
            to
            -
            day stuff,
            absolutely everybody texts, not just the younger generations.
          </p><p>.Antony:
            Well, then if most people use technology much more than they would use
            handwriting for even the simplest of daily tasks, the question is, shoul
            d we keep
            handwriting?
          </p><p>.Anne:
            Well,
            the first thing is that handwriting actually in some way stimulates cognitive
            processing. By that I mean it helps us to learn, it helps us retain information, it helps us
            develop other skills such as reading, and it's eve
            n been found to help with
            mathematics. Handwriting is as personal as the clothes you wear, it's something which
            is part of you.
          </p><p>.Antony
            : So, you believe that handwriting is actually better than texting or typing.
            So we
            should continue to teach it.
          </p><p>.Anne
            : Yes, absolutely. And there seems to be pretty solid evidence that handwriting in
            preschool changes the brain, that there is a link between handwriting and learning how
            to read. Handwriting is a skill which has to be taught. If we don't teach it, it will
            die out.
          </p><p>.Antony:
            But, what about the link between typing and learning to read? Or is
            handwriting unique in its ability to help us to develop our reading skills?
          </p><p>.Anne:
            There is no evidence out there that tablets and computers are having an effect
            on rea
            ding.
          </p><p>.Antony
            : Well, you also say that handwriting changes the brain, then ..., if our brain is
            highly adaptable, is it possible that over time our brains will change because of the use
            of technology?
          </p><p>.Anne
            : It is true that digital technologies will become
            more common, and so sure, we
            probably will adjust to them, but adaptation is going to take a long, long time. Writing
            has gone through many changes in the 6,000 years since humans have been writing.
          </p><p>.Antony:
            So texting or typing is simply another step, y
            ou would say, in the evolving
            history of the way in which we communicate.
          </p><p>.Anne
            : Exactly. For instance, if you look back at the Roman world, carving on stone is
            something that used to be done much more than it is now. We’ve lost many things in
            the history
            of writing.
          </p><p>.Antony
: The big question, I suppose, is how does it change the way in which you
communicate?
</p><p>.Anne
: This is a very good question. We have to remember that the technology itself is
really changing all the time and I think that we should be lookin
g way beyond text and
type to a new stage of communication.
</p><p>.Antony:
A next stage of communication? What do you mean by that?
</p><p>.Anne:
I started noticing, you know, people walking down the streets and they'd be
talking into their phones and they were not ta
lking to a person, they were dictating a
text message, or an email. They were composing texts.
</p><p>.Antony:
So, you mean that people have now started to compose text on their phones
with their voice?
</p><p>.Anne:
Exactly. If you speak in a clear voice you can genera
te an email, a text
message, a note to yourself on a mobile device. So, we are starting to see a new
practice, voice dictation, writing text by speaking it. I call it “voice writing”.
</p><p>.Antony:
So, if people are going to be doing composition with their voi
ce, could we train
them to do it well, in the same way that when we teach people to handwrite?
</p><p>.Anne:
Right now we know little about handwriting and typing. If you want to take
notes, if you want to understand what someone is telling you in a lecture, research
seems to suggest that it's better to write by hand because you go more slowly but you
think mor
e about what's actually there, even if you go more slowly. If you type, you'll
tend to just transcribe the contents, you won't think about the meaning as much. So we
could now start to think of the situations when writing with your voice might be the best
cognitive tool.
</p><p>.Antony:
But when you look at the amount of time in schools that is put into
communication, that's put into things like writing, presumably some of that is going to
have to change, isn't it?
</p><p>.Anne:
Well,
one of the things that we forget is
that we've always had multiple channels
to enter information into computers. The fact that we use keyboards today doesn't
mean that we will use keyboards forever. I think it's somewhat naive to think that
handwriting is just going to disappear in the near
future.
</p><p>.Antony:
Thank you very much for sharing your time with us.
</p><p>.Anne:
My pleasure. Thank you.
