            PRESENTER (REPORTER): You have probably seen our guest on ITV’s new show
“Dance”
or maybe you have been to the theater where she is now performing ‘Aladdin’.
After dancing with the ballet company for five years, she is starting to break into
principal roles and discover what it means to be at the top of their profession.
Otherwise the
chances are that you follow her on Instagram... after all, she boasts over
100,000 followers. In today’s program,
I’m going to interview
Claire Petty
.
</p><p>.REPORTER: Hi, Anne. Welcome to our programme.
</p><p>.CLAIRE: My pleasure.
</p><p>.REPORTER:
To start, tell us a little
about yourself.
</p><p>.CLAIRE: I started dancing at the age of four, doing ballet, because I had a lot of energy
and my mum needed to channel it into something productive! I was very lucky
that at the age of 12 I had a teacher that guided me more towards the
classical
route, and I joined the School of American Ballet in New York when I was 14. I
worked with the New York City Ballet my last year at school, and we performed
‘Nutcracker’ that year, which was an amazing experience. I went back to school
that Janua
ry and on the first day back my head teacher told me I had a job at
the Boston Ballet and that I started work the next day
—
I literally re
-
packed all
my things and hopped on the plane straightaway!
</p><p>.REPORTER: What advice do you wish someone had given you at
15?
</p><p>.CLAIRE: I wish someone had told me not to let people tell me
that
I can’t do
something. At school most of my teachers told me dance was a waste of time
and that I couldn’t make a career out of it. That really upset me because I had
put so much into it
and my family made a lot of sacrifices. But as I got older, I
realised that those people motivated me to prove them wrong and I guess they
will always motivate me, because now when people tell me I can’t do
something, I make sure I
DO
do it.
</p><p>.REPORTER:
Bal
let is a pretty demanding profession: there are long hours, it’s very
physical, you have to travel a lot. What motivates you?
</p><p>.CLAIRE: It’s just those times on stage where you’re either doing a role you love, or
you’re in a really beautiful theatre, and som
etimes you just realise how lucky
you are to be doing a job where you absolutely love it, and you’re doing your
hobby as a career. Those moments push you through. You’ve done all that hard
work in the studio, you’ve tried to get your technique to the highe
st standard it
can be, and then you just need to enjoy that moment on stage.
</p><p>.REPORTER:
There must be a fine balance between relaxing after a long day of
rehearsals and thinking over the work you’ve done that day. How do you
manage that?
</p><p>.CLAIRE: Immediatel
y after rehearsal, I like to reflect a little bit on the positive things.
There’s always going to be something that’s gone wrong
—
I don’t think you ever
walk away thinking ‘well, that was perfect’
—
but that’s the beauty of performing
a character role because
every day can be different. The way we perform
‘Aladdin’ in our first show will be different from the way we play it in our second
show. That’s what’s exciting
–
the growth, and the change, and responding to
each other.
</p><p>.REPORTER: You’re super busy! What
do you do to relax and chill out?
</p><p>.CLAIRE: Ha ha. I have very little free time, which is how I like it
—
I hate being bored. I
go to the movies, hang out with my dance friends, watch TV, listen to music, do
all those normal things. It’s good to chill out and
remind yourself that, as brilliant
as ballet is, there’s a big world out there.
</p><p>.REPORTER: You’ve already danced with Justin Bieber and Jennifer Lopez. What has
been your career highlight so far?
</p><p>.CLAIRE: Dancing for Justin Bieber and definitely Jennifer L
opez have been major
highlights but I’m excited about working with Lady Gaga on her dancing videos
for her new album. That’s been really cool, and I can’t wait for everyone to see
what she’s been working on!
</p><p>.REPORTER: Which musical icons do you dream about
working or dancing with one
day?
</p><p>.CLAIRE: I’ve always wanted to dance for Beyoncé. She’s a very talented dancer
herself, with so much energy. It’s definitely something I would love to do. Being
involved with Lady Gaga’s music clips and seeing what is invol
ved in the
process has opened my eyes to professional dancing outside ballet and I’ve
loved it, so I hope dancing for other musical icons is just as fun. It’s lot of hard
work but rewarding for sure.
</p><p>.REPORTER: I was following you on Instagram earlier and t
here’s a fan page for you!
What’s it like going from living a normal life to dealing with the fame that comes
with your profile now?
</p><p>.CLAIRE: Ha ha. It’s no different, to be honest! Most of the fans are from overseas, so
my life here hasn’t changed all that
much in the past five years. When I go out,
a few people recognize me and it’s nice, but I’m not that famous.
</p><p>.REPORTER: What’s next for you?
</p><p>.CLAIRE: I’m going to the Dominican Republic in August for the World Latin Dance
Championship to perform in Jennife
r Lopez’s show there
–
I’m very excited
about that! We also have stuff happening in Australia after and possibly
Switzerland. Then I’m filming the rest of the episodes for “Dance”, which I’m
looking forward to.
</p><p>.REPORTER: Finally, if you weren’t a dancer, w
hat would you be doing?
</p><p>.CLAIRE: I’d quite like to learn something about architecture and interior design
because I’ve always liked drawing, but I’ve never had time to work on it
properly. I’ve always loved walking into a stylish home. It’s my dream to bui
ld
my own house and decorate it with things from all around the world .
</p><p>.REPORTER: Well, Claire, it’s been a pleasure having you here tonight.
</p><p>.CLAIRE: Thank you for inviting me.
