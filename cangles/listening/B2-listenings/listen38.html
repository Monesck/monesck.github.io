          <p>.  Reporter:
            Good morning, Johnston and thanks for accepting our invitation.
          </p><p>. Mr Johnston:
            Thank you for inviting me.
          </p><p>. Reporter:
            Why did you decide to run for the mayor of Norwich, Mr. Johnston?
          </p><p>. Mr. Johnston:
            Well, I have to admit that I only decided to run for mayor one year
            before election time. So, it’s something recent. For about 10 years I'd been working for
            the labour party helping organise city events, designing projects to make our city a
            better one. I’ve been the mayor of Norwich for two years, now and I still have many
            things to do to improve in the city.
          </p><p>. Reporter:
            How did you get into politics then?
          </p><p>. Mr. Johnston:
            I’ve always been into politics, you know. My father was a city counselor
            and he was a Member of Parliament for 8 years. Politics has always been part of my
            life. So when I finished my degree in Law I joined the Labour party and worked for it in
            my city. You know, I was born in Norwich and I’ve lived in this city all my life. I only
            lived away when I studied at London University
            and when I took a master’s degree at
            Harvard University. Seven years away fr
            om my beloved city. That was more than
            enough! So I came back and decided to help Norwich become a much better city and
            I’ve been working for it ever since.
          </p><p>.Reporter:
It seems to me that you’re in love with this city. Tell our listeners something
about it. For instance, why should people come and visit it?
</p><p>.Mr. Johnston:
In the 11
th
century Norwich was the largest city in England after London
and one of the most important places in the country. In fact, from the medieval period
until the start of the Industrial Revolution, Norwich was England’s second city,
enormously prosperous and culturally active. This has created a rich heritage, for
example we are proud to have the largest inta
ct medieval street pattern in Europe.
</p><p>.Reporter:
One of the city’s most famous landmarks is Norwich Castle. Tell us
something about it.
</p><p>.Mr. Johnston:
It was built by the Normans as a Royal Palace 900 years ago. Now it is
a museum and art gallery, and home to some of the most outstanding collections of
fine art, archaeology and natural history. But let me tell you that my favourite place
there is the Norman keep, which has been made into a new space where models,
computers and videos bring history vividly to life.
</p><p>.Reporter:
And what can you say about the Cathedral? I think it is another remarkable
building, isn’t it?
</p><p>.Mr. Johnston
: Yes. Norwich’s Cathedral is magnificent: it is one of the finest complete
Romanesque cathedrals in Europe. It has the second tallest spire and the largest
monastic cloister in England. It is set in beautiful grounds as well. If we had time for it I
would tell you all the big things our city has. And there are a lot!!!
</p><p>.Reporter:
You are right; unfortunately we don’t have time for that much. So let me ask
you about a special event this summer. Norwich was on the screen on the occasion of
the Olympic Torch Relay.
</p><p>.Mr. Johnston:
Indeed! We were very excited that Norwich was chosen as one of the
destination cities for the Olympic Torch Relay. There was a whole city celebration
welcoming the Olympic Torch to the streets of Norwich on Wednesday 4 and Thursday
5 July. We had a packed programme, which continued late into the evening, including
the Olympic stage show, a line-up of bands and street theatre in the city center, and a
spectacular 3D video projection.
</p><p>.Reporter:
I’ve also read there were some spectacular street decorations...
</p><p>.Mr. Johnston:
Oh yes! The route was animated with activities created by arts
organisations and communities who had worked together to design and make giant
puppets, flags and human pyramids. Trees along the route were covered in Olympic
colours, banners in lampposts and the whole city was dressed to welcome the Torch.
I’ll never forget that day. The whole city
seemed to be so happy, even the weather was
great, the sun shining, amazing really amazing.
</p><p>.Reporter:
Well, Mr Johnston
I can see you’re proud of your city
.
</p><p>.Mr. Johnston:
Indeed I am.
</p><p>.Reporter:
Thank you for sharing your city with us for some minutes. It’s been a
pleasure.
</p><p>.Mr. Johnston:
Thank you!
